Three models, A, B1, & B2, that conditionally pass messages. Model A receives input from a tab delimited table and sends output to both models B1 & B2. The outputs to models B1 & B2 only succeed if the data satisfies conditions described in the YAML. Output from both models B1 & B2 are sent to a tab delimited table.
