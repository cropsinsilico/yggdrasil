Three models (two clients, one server) run in a client-server, remote procedure call (RPC) communication pattern. The client models (`rpcFibCli` and `rpcFibCliPar`) send requests and receive response to/from the server model `rpcFibSrv`. The `rpcFibCli` model sends & receives requests/responses via the deprecated `rpcCall` method (use `call` instead), while `rpcFibCliPar` uses the separate send/recv methods `rpcSend` and `rpcRecv` (use `send` & `recv` instead). The server model receives requests and send responses. The `rpcFibCli` model also reads text data from and input file and sends each request/response pair to an output file. This example demostrates the RPC pattern through the use of the `client_of` and `is_server` model parameters and the RPC interface classes/functions, including splitting calls into their send/recv components. The models also receive parameters via the command line as specified in the YAML `args` model parameter.
