Two models run in a client-server, remote procedure call (RPC) communication pattern. The client model `client` sends requests and receives response to/from the server model `server` via the deprecated `call` method. The server model receives requests and send responses. The `client` model receives request data from a file and send responses to a file. In the case of both models, yggdrasil auto-wraps functions with interface calls at runtime. This example demostrates the RPC pattern through the use of the `client_of` and `is_server` model parameters and the RPC interface classes/functions in conjunction with automated wrapping of model functions, including the use of the `global_scope` interface parameter when autowrapping functions that contain interface calls themselves.
