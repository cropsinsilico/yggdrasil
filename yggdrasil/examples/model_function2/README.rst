Two models, A & B, that send/receive scalars and arrays. Model A iterates over received array input from a table, calling the indicated model function for each array element, and then sends all of outputs from the iteration as an array to model B. Model B receives input arrays from model A and sends it's output to a file. Both models are functions that are automatically wrapped by yggdrasil with the appropriate interface calls. This example demonstrates the use of the `function` model YAML parameter and auto-wrapping as well as iteration over input/output arrays via the `iter_function_over` model YAML paramter.
