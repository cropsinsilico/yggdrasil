    Args:
        name (str): Unique name used to identify the model. This will
            be used to report errors associated with the model.
        args (str or list): The full path to the file containing the
            model program that will be run by the driver or a list
            starting with the program file and including any arguments
            that should be passed as input to the program.
        products (list, optional): Paths to files created by the model that
            should be cleaned up when the model exits. Entries can be absolute
            paths or paths relative to the working directory. Defaults to [].
        function (str, optional): If provided, an integrated model is
            created by wrapping the function named here. The function must be
            located within the file specified by the source file listed in the
            first argument. If not provided, the model must contain it's own
            calls to the |yggdrasil| interface.
        source_products (list, optional): Files created by running the model
            that are source files. These files will be removed without checking
            their extension so users should avoid adding files to this list
            unless they are sure they should be deleted. Defaults to [].
        is_server (bool, optional): If `True`, the model is assumed to be a
            server for one or more client models and an instance of
            :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. The
            corresponding channel that should be passed to the yggdrasil API
            will be the name of the model. Defaults to False. Use of `is_server`
            with `function` is not currently supported.
        client_of (str, list, optional): The names of one or more models that
            this model will call as a server. If there are more than one, this
            should be specified as a sequence collection (list). The
            corresponding channel(s) that should be passed to the yggdrasil API
            will be the name of the server model joined with the name of the
            client model with an underscore `<server_model>_<client_model>`.
            There will be one channel created for each server the model is a
            client of. Defaults to empty list. Use of `client_of` with `function`
            is not currently supported.
        overwrite (bool, optional): If True, any existing model products
            (compilation products, wrapper scripts, etc.) are removed prior to
            the run. If False, the products are not removed. Defaults to True.
            Setting this to False can improve the performance, particularly for
            models that take a long time to compile, but this should only be
            done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run
            is tested on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword
            also determines whether or not products are removed after a run.
        preserve_cache (bool, optional): If True model products will be kept
            following the run, otherwise all products will be cleaned up.
            Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.
        with_strace (bool, optional): If True, the command is run with strace (on
            Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS). Defaults to False.
        strace_flags (list, optional): Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace).
            Defaults to [].
        with_valgrind (bool, optional): If True, the command is run with valgrind.
            Defaults to False.
        valgrind_flags (list, optional): Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].
        model_index (int, optional): Index of model in list of models being run.
            Defaults to 0.
        outputs_in_inputs (bool, optional): If True, outputs from wrapped model
            functions are passed by pointer as inputs for modification and the
            return value will be a flag. If False, outputs are limited to
            return values. Defaults to the value of the class attribute
            outputs_in_inputs.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments are passed to parent class.
