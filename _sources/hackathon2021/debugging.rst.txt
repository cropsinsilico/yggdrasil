Debugging
#########

For those participating in the CiS 2021 Hackathon in June 2021 and those referencing these materials later, we recommend the following strategies for debugging issues you have accessing the notebooks.

#. If you are trying the MyBinder set up and are using a browser other than Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari, install one of those and try again
#. Check for similar issues that have been reported as issues `here <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/issues>`_ including the issues that have been `closed <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed>`_.
#. If your issue has not been reported, open a new one `here <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/issues/new>`_.
#. If you are having issues with a local install, check `this page <https://cropsinsilico.github.io/yggdrasil/debugging.html>`_ for known errors and their solutions.
