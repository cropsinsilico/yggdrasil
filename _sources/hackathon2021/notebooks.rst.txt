Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
#################################

After following one of the three sets of instructions for :ref:`setting up the hackathon materials <setup>`, you should see a file browser similar to the one shown below in your web browser.

This page is showing you the contents of the `hackathon materials repository <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon>`_ that are being accessed by a Jupyter server. You can open the first notebook by clicking on the ``00-intro.ipynb`` file which will launch the notebook in a new tab.

Jupyter notebooks like this one are useful for running code alongside text and graphics giving context to the code and plots & animations of results from the code. For descriptions of the examples and tasks presented in the notebooks, including how to run code, refer to the text within the notebooks. Brief descriptions of the included notebooks can be found below.
