append              boolean              If True and writing, file is openned in append mode. If True and reading, file  
                                         is kept open even if the end of the file is reached to allow for another process

                                         field names are created based on the field order.

                                         tables. This keyword is only valid for table-like datatypes. If not provided,

wait_for_creation   float                Time (in seconds) that should be waited before opening for the file to be
