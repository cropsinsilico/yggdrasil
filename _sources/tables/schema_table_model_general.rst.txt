args                 array     X          The full path to the file containing the model program that will be run by the  
                                          driver or a list starting with the program file and including any arguments that
                                          should be passed as input to the program.                                       
language             string    X          The programming language that the model is written in. A list of available      
                                          languages can be found :ref:`here <schema_table_model_subtype_rst>`. (Options

name                 string    X          Name used for component in log messages.                                        
working_dir          string    X          Working directory. If not provided, the current working directory is used.      
allow_threading      boolean              If True, comm connections will be set up so that the model-side comms can be    
                                          used by more than one thread. Defaults to False.                                
client_of            array                The names of one or more models that this model will call as a server. If there 
                                          are more than one, this should be specified as a sequence collection (list). The
                                          corresponding channel(s) that should be passed to the yggdrasil API will be the 
                                          name of the server model joined with the name of the client model with an       
                                          underscore `<server_model>_<client_model>`. There will be one channel created   
                                          for each server the model is a client of. Defaults to empty list. Use of        
                                          `client_of` with `function` is not currently supported.                         
copies               integer              The number of copies of the model that should be created. Defaults to 1.        
driver               string               [DEPRECATED] Name of driver class that should be used.                          
env                  object               Dictionary of environment variables that should be set when the driver starts.  
                                          Defaults to {}.                                                                 
function             string               If provided, an integrated model is created by wrapping the function named here.
                                          The function must be located within the file specified by the source file listed
                                          in the first argument. If not provided, the model must contain it's own calls to
                                          the |yggdrasil| interface.                                                      
inputs               array                A mapping object containing the entry for a model input channel or a list of    
                                          input channel entries. If the model does not get input from another model, this 
                                          may be ommitted. A full description of channel entries and the options available
                                          for channels can be found :ref:`here<yaml_comm_options>`.                       
is_server                                 If `True`, the model is assumed to be a server for one or more client models and
                                          an instance of :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. The          
                                          corresponding channel that should be passed to the yggdrasil API will be the    
                                          name of the model. If is_server is a dictionary, it should contain an 'input'   
                                          key and an 'output' key. These are required to be the names of existing input   
                                          and output channels in the model that will be co-opted by the server. (Note:    
                                          This requires that the co-opted output channel's send method is called once for 
                                          each time the co-opted input channel's recv method is called. If used with the  
                                          `function` parameter, `is_server` must be a dictionary. Defaults to False.      
iter_function_over   array                Variable(s) that should be received or sent as an array, but iterated over.     
                                          Defaults to an empty array and is ignored.                                      
logging_level        string               The level of logging messages that should be displayed by the model. Defaults to
                                          the logging level as determined by the configuration file and environment       
                                          variables.                                                                      
outputs              array                A mapping object containing the entry for a model output channel or a list of   
                                          output channel entries. If the model does not output to another model, this may 
                                          be ommitted. A full description of channel entries and the options available for
                                          channels can be found :ref:`here<yaml_comm_options>`.                           
outputs_in_inputs    boolean              If True, outputs from wrapped model functions are passed by pointer as inputs   
                                          for modification and the return value will be a flag. If False, outputs are     
                                          limited to return values. Defaults to the value of the class attribute          
                                          outputs_in_inputs.                                                              
overwrite            boolean              If True, any existing model products (compilation products, wrapper scripts,    
                                          etc.) are removed prior to the run. If False, the products are not removed.     
                                          Defaults to True. Setting this to False can improve the performance,            
                                          particularly for models that take a long time to compile, but this should only  
                                          be done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run is tested
                                          on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword also determines whether 
                                          or not products are removed after a run.                                        
preserve_cache       boolean              If True model products will be kept following the run, otherwise all products   
                                          will be cleaned up. Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.
products             array                Paths to files created by the model that should be cleaned up when the model    
                                          exits. Entries can be absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory.
                                          Defaults to [].                                                                 
source_products      array                Files created by running the model that are source files. These files will be   
                                          removed without checking their extension so users should avoid adding files to  
                                          this list unless they are sure they should be deleted. Defaults to [].          
strace_flags         array                Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace). Defaults to [].                            
timesync                                  If set, the model is assumed to call a send then receive of the state at each   
                                          timestep for syncronization with other models that are also integrating in time.
                                          If a string is provided, it is assumed to be the name of the server that will   
                                          handle timestep synchronization. If a boolean is provided, the name of the      
                                          server will be assumed to be 'timestep'. Defaults to False.                     
valgrind_flags       array                Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].                                      
with_strace          boolean              If True, the command is run with strace (on Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS).        
                                          Defaults to False.                                                              
with_valgrind        boolean              If True, the command is run with valgrind. Defaults to False.
