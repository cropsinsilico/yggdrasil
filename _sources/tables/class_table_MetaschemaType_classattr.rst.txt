cross_language_support   If True, this indicates the types should be serializable across most (if not                  bool      
                         all) of the supported languages. If False, this type is not required to be                              
                         serializable except to/from Python. Defaults to True.                                                   
definition_properties    Type properties that are required for YAML or form entries specifying the type.               list      
                         These will also be used to validate type definitions. These properties will be                          
                         added to those from the parent type class unless inherit_properties is False.                           
                         Defaults to ['type'].                                                                                   
description              A short description of the type.                                                   X          str       
extract_properties       Properties that will be extracted from the metadata of a message to construct                 list      
                         the type definition. These properties will be added to those from the parent                            
                         class unless inherit_properties is False. Defaults to ['type', 'title'].                                
inherit_properties       If True, a type class's properties will be a combination of the parent class's                bool, list
                         properties and those explicitly defined in the child class. If False, a type                            
                         class's properties will only be those explicitly defined in the child class. If                         
                         a list of property attributes, only properties specified by those attributes                            
                         will be inherited from the parent class.                                                                
is_fixed                 True if the type is a fixed version of another type. See FixedMetaschemaType for              bool      
                         details.                                                                                                
loaded_schema_file       The path to the file the schema for the type was loaded from if it was loaded.                str, None 
metadata_properties      Type properties that are required for deserializing instances of the type that                list      
                         have been serialized. These properties will be added to those from the parent                           
                         class unless inherit_properties is False. Defaults to ['type'].                                         
name                     Name of the type for use in YAML files & form options.                             X          str       
properties               List of JSON schema properties that this type uses. These properties will be                  list      
                         added to those form the paretn type class unless inherit_properties is False.                           
                         Defaults to ['type', 'title'].                                                                          
python_types             List of python types that this type encompasses. [REQUIRED].                                  list      
schema_file              If set, the class's schema is loaded from the specified file at registration and              str, None 
                         moved to the loaded_schema_file class attribute. Defaults to None.                                      
specificity              Specificity of the type. Types with larger values are more specific while types               int       
                         with smaller values are more general. Base types have a specificity of 0. More                          
                         specific types are checked first before more general ones.
