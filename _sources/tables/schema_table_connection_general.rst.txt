args              string              [DEPRECATED] Arguments that should be provided to the driver.                   
connection_type   string               (Options described :ref:`here <schema_table_connection_subtype_rst>`)          
driver            string              [DEPRECATED] Name of driver class that should be used.                          
input_pattern     string              The communication pattern that should be used to handle incoming messages when  
                                      there is more than one input communicators present. Defaults to 'cycle'. Options
                                      include: 'cycle': Receive from the next available input communicator. 'gather': 
                                      Receive lists of messages with one element from each communicator where a       
                                      message is only returned when there is a message from each.                     
onexit            string              Class method that should be called when a model that the connection interacts   
                                      with exits, but before the connection driver is shut down. Defaults to None.    
output_pattern    string              The communication pattern that should be used to handling outgoing messages when
                                      there is more than one output communicator present. Defaults to 'broadcast'.    
                                      Options include: 'cycle': Rotate through output comms, sending one message to   
                                      each. 'broadcast': Send the same message to each comm. 'scatter': Send part of  
                                      message (must be a list) to each comm.                                          
translator        array               Function or string specifying function that should be used to translate messages
                                      from the input communicator before passing them to the output communicator. If a
                                      string, the format should be "<package.module>:<function>" so that <function>   
                                      can be imported from <package>. Defaults to None and messages are passed        
                                      directly. This can also be a list of functions/strings that will be called on   
                                      the messages in the order they are provided.
