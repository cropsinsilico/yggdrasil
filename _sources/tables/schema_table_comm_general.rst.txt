datatype         schema    X          JSON schema (with expanded core types defined by |yggdrasil|) that constrains   
                                      the type of data that should be sent/received by this object. Defaults to

                                      with either columns rather than row by row. Defaults to False.                  
default_file                          Comm information for a file that input should be drawn from (for input comms) or
                                      that output should be sent to (for output comms) in the event that a yaml does  
                                      not pair the comm with another model comm or a file.                            
default_value    any                  Value that should be returned in the event that a yaml does not pair the comm   
                                      with another model comm or a file.                                              
dont_copy        boolean              If True, the comm will not be duplicated in the even a model is duplicated via  
                                      the 'copies' parameter. Defaults to False except for in the case that a model is
                                      wrapped and the comm is inside the loop or that a model is a RPC input to a     
                                      model server.

                                      tables. This keyword is only valid for table-like datatypes. If not provided,   
                                      field names are created based on the field order.                               
field_units      array                [DEPRECATED] Field units that should be used to convert fields in sent/received 
                                      tables. This keyword is only valid for table-like datatypes. If not provided,   
                                      all fields are assumed to be unitless.                                          
filter                                Filter that will be used to determine when messages should be sent/received.    
                                      Ignored if not provided.

is_default       boolean              If True, this comm was created to handle all input/output variables to/from a   
                                      model. Defaults to False. This variable is used internally and should not be set
                                      explicitly in the YAML.                                                         
length_map       object               Map from pointer variable names to the names of variables where their length

outside_loop     boolean              If True, and the comm is an input/outputs to/from a model being wrapped. The    
                                      receive/send calls for this comm will be outside the loop for the model.        
                                      Defaults to False.

send_converter                        Converter that should be used on sent objects. Defaults to None.                
transform                             One or more transformations that will be applied to messages that are
