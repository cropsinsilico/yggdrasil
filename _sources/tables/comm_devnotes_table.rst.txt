zmq      A ZeroMQ endpoint of the form              |yggdrasil| uses the tcp transport by default with a PAIR socket type. For every

         transport. Additional information can be   first send, the model should create a REP socket on an open tcp address and send

         <http://api.zeromq.org/3-2:zmq-bind>`_.    Receiving models should check message headers for this key and, on receipt,     
                                                    establish the partner REQ socket with the specified address (receiving comms can
