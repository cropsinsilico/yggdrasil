args                   The model executable and any arguments that should be passed to the model          X          str or list
                       executable.                                                                                              
name                   Driver name.                                                                       X          str        
compiler               Command or path to executable that should be used to compile the model. If not                str        
                       provided, the compiler will be determined based on configuration options for the                         
                       language (if present) and the registered compilers that are available on the                             
                       current operating system.                                                                                
compiler_flags         Flags that should be passed to the compiler during compilation. If nto provided,              list       
                       the compiler flags will be determined based on configuration options for the                             
                       language (if present), the compiler defaults, and the default_compiler_flags                             
                       class attribute.                                                                                         
disable_python_c_api   If True, the Python C API will be disabled. Defaults to False.                                bool       
linker                 Command or path to executable that should be used to link the model. If not                   str        
                       provided, the linker will be determined based on configuration options for the                           
                       language (if present) and the registered linkers that are available on the                               
                       current operating system                                                                                 
linker_flags           Flags that should be passed to the linker during compilation. If not provided,                list       
                       the linker flags will be determined based on configuration options for the                               
                       language (if present), the linker defaults, and the default_linker_flags class                           
                       attribute.                                                                                               
source_files           Source files that should be compiled into an executable. Defaults to an empty                 list       
                       list and the driver will search for a source file based on the model executable                          
                       (the first model argument).                                                                              
with_asan              If True, the model will be compiled and linked with the address sanitizer                     bool       
                       enabled (if there is one available for the selected compiler).
