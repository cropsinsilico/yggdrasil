args                The full path to the file containing the model program that will be run by the     X          str or list
                    driver or a list starting with the program file and including any arguments that                         
                    should be passed as input to the program.                                                                
name                Unique name used to identify the model. This will be used to report errors         X          str        
                    associated with the model.                                                                               
client_of           The names of one or more models that this model will call as a server. If there               str, list  
                    are more than one, this should be specified as a sequence collection (list). The                         
                    corresponding channel(s) that should be passed to the yggdrasil API will be the                          
                    name of the server model joined with the name of the client model with an                                
                    underscore `<server_model>_<client_model>`. There will be one channel created                            
                    for each server the model is a client of. Defaults to empty list. Use of                                 
                    `client_of` with `function` is not currently supported.                                                  
function            If provided, an integrated model is created by wrapping the function named here.              str        
                    The function must be located within the file specified by the source file listed                         
                    in the first argument. If not provided, the model must contain it's own calls to                         
                    the |yggdrasil| interface.                                                                               
is_server           If `True`, the model is assumed to be a server for one or more client models and              bool, dict 
                    an instance of :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. The                                   
                    corresponding channel that should be passed to the yggdrasil API will be the                             
                    name of the model. If is_server is a dictionary, it should contain an 'input'                            
                    key and an 'output' key. These are required to be the names of existing input                            
                    and output channels in the model that will be co-opted by the server. (Note:                             
                    This requires that the co-opted output channel's send method is called once for                          
                    each time the co-opted input channel's recv method is called. If used with the                           
                    `function` parameter, `is_server` must be a dictionary. Defaults to False.                               
logging_level       The level of logging messages that should be displayed by the model. Defaults to              str        
                    the logging level as determined by the configuration file and environment                                
                    variables.                                                                                               
model_index         Index of model in list of models being run. Defaults to 0.                                    int        
outputs_in_inputs   If True, outputs from wrapped model functions are passed by pointer as inputs                 bool       
                    for modification and the return value will be a flag. If False, outputs are                              
                    limited to return values. Defaults to the value of the class attribute                                   
                    outputs_in_inputs.                                                                                       
overwrite           If True, any existing model products (compilation products, wrapper scripts,                  bool       
                    etc.) are removed prior to the run. If False, the products are not removed.                              
                    Defaults to True. Setting this to False can improve the performance,                                     
                    particularly for models that take a long time to compile, but this should only                           
                    be done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run is tested                         
                    on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword also determines whether                          
                    or not products are removed after a run.                                                                 
preserve_cache      If True model products will be kept following the run, otherwise all products                 bool       
                    will be cleaned up. Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.                         
products            Paths to files created by the model that should be cleaned up when the model                  list       
                    exits. Entries can be absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory.                         
                    Defaults to [].                                                                                          
source_products     Files created by running the model that are source files. These files will be                 list       
                    removed without checking their extension so users should avoid adding files to                           
                    this list unless they are sure they should be deleted. Defaults to [].                                   
strace_flags        Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace). Defaults to [].                                          list       
timesync            If set, the model is assumed to call a send then receive of the state at each                 bool, str  
                    timestep for syncronization with other models that are also integrating in time.                         
                    If a string is provided, it is assumed to be the name of the server that will                            
                    handle timestep synchronization. If a boolean is provided, the name of the                               
                    server will be assumed to be 'timestep'. Defaults to False.                                              
valgrind_flags      Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].                                                    list       
with_strace         If True, the command is run with strace (on Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS).                      bool       
                    Defaults to False.                                                                                       
with_valgrind       If True, the command is run with valgrind. Defaults to False.                                 bool
